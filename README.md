# Pagination

The application generates page pagination based on the parameters provided by the user - number of pages and offsets from the current page.

The list.js library was used to generate pagination. The pagination plugin has many interesting options. An example is the "innerWindow" option used. It is responsible for how many pages should be visible on each side of the current page.
